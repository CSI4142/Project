# Bank Customer Churn Project

For **Part B** of Phase 3, BI dashboard and information visualization, we have used **Metabase**. Metabase is an open-source business intelligence tool that allows users to create and share dashboards and data visualizations. It can be installed and run locally, but can also be hosted on a server using their docker image.

## Metabase Dashboard

We've hosted our Metabase instance on a cloud server, and it can be accessed using the following link:
[https://csi.pkural.ca/](https://csi.pkural.ca/)

Credentials to access Metabase are provided in the BI Dashboard PDF file submitted in the phase 3 submission.

If you only need to view the BI dashboard, it can be viewed live at: [https://csi.pkural.ca/public/dashboard/f079838a-6014-4cb4-894d-cb88a743755c](https://csi.pkural.ca/public/dashboard/f079838a-6014-4cb4-894d-cb88a743755c)

## Running Metabase Locally

Using a cloud-hosted instance of our BI tool allows for easier team collaboration and management of the dashboard. The dashboard can be accessed by anyone with the link, and the data can be updated in real-time.

If you wish to run Metabase locally, you can follow the instructions on their website: [https://www.metabase.com/start/oss/](https://www.metabase.com/start/oss/). When setting up the database connection for your local Metabase instance, you can either use the connection details of cloud-hosted PostgreSQL database provided in the project report, or provide the connection details of your local PostgreSQL database. If using your local database, ensure you have loaded and staged the data. You can follow the instructions in the [phase2/README.md](../phase2/README.md) to load and stage the data.
